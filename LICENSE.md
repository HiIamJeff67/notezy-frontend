4. Ownership
   Notezy and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including all intellectual property rights. This EULA does not transfer any ownership.

5. Third-Party Components and Open Source
   The Software may include or depend on third-party or open-source components that are licensed under their own terms. Those terms govern your use of those components, and nothing in this EULA is intended to limit your rights under such third-party licenses. You agree to comply with all applicable third-party license terms.

6. Trademarks and Branding
   You may not use Notezy’s names, logos, or trademarks, or any confusingly similar marks, without Notezy’s prior written consent. You may make purely descriptive, truthful references (e.g., “compatible with Notezy”) provided you include an appropriate attribution and disclaimer of endorsement.

7. Updates and Support
   Notezy may, but is not obligated to, provide updates, patches, or support. Any updates are governed by this EULA (or a successor version provided with the update).

8. Fees and Taxes (if applicable)
   If your license is fee-bearing, you agree to pay all applicable fees and taxes. Failure to pay constitutes a material breach.

9. Term and Termination
   This EULA is effective until terminated. It will automatically terminate if you breach any term. Upon termination, you must cease all use and delete all copies of the Software. Sections intended to survive (including 3–6, 8–15) will remain in effect.

10. Disclaimer of Warranties
    THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

11. Limitation of Liability
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NOTEZY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL. NOTEZY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS SHALL NOT EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.

12. Export and Compliance
    You will comply with all applicable export control and sanctions laws. You represent that you are not a prohibited party under such laws.

14. Assignment
    You may not assign or transfer this EULA without Notezy’s prior written consent. Notezy may assign this EULA without restriction.

15. Entire Agreement; Severability; Waiver; Order of Precedence
    This EULA constitutes the entire agreement regarding the Software and supersedes all prior agreements. If any provision is held unenforceable, it will be modified to the minimum extent necessary to be enforceable, and the remainder will remain in effect. Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver. In any translation, the English version controls in case of conflict.
